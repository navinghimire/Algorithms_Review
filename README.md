## How to Prepare?
* Try solving on your own.
  * You are *mostly* on your own at the job. Think about **space** and **time** complexity.
* Write on paper.
  * Avoid the luxury of syntax highlighting, code completion, and quick debugging.
* Test 
  * Cosider base case, error cases and/or edge cases.
* Type paper code as is into a computer.
  * List all erros you made, avoid it in your interview.
